    <h1>Com 541 - Project 1</h1>
    <h2>Christine McClure</h2>
    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>This project used reference transactions from the Galvin Library during the Fall 2013 semester (August 19 &mdash; December 7). The data includes the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of transactions by hour</li>
      <li>How the patron contacted the reference department: in person, email, phone, etc.</li>
      <li>Location of the person answering the question: reference desk, office, home, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Show that there are few transaction recorded in the evening hours so we can reallocate those hours to where they are most needed.</p>
    <h3>Existing statistics</h3>

    <h3>Initial ideas</h3>
    <p>After noticing that the bulk of transactions occurred between 10am and 3pm, I thought I could relate that to an image of the sun rising and setting. Here was an initial sketch: </p>
    <img src="images/sun-sketch.png" />
    <p>Then I realized that I wanted to show the number of transactions in scale. This worked well in Adobe Illustrator, where 139 transactions easily became a circle that was 139 pixels wide &mdash; and could be easily resized in a vector program. Here is a test from the "all transaction" data:</p>
