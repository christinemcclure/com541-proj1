    <h1>Small-Display Format</h1>
    <h2>Initial ideas</h2>
    <p>For this image, I knew I wanted a display that would include a separate data point for each reference transaction. This would allow me to take advantage of a small screen display that allowed for more pixels, more density in the image, and the ability of the user to interact with the screen and zoom in on parts if they chose to.</p>
    <p>I also wanted to use icons to identify the different formats of the transactions, but I wanted to make sure they weren't too "cute." This was mostly avoided by using simple outlines and standard icons for the format. I first created the icons like this:</p>
    <img src="images/icons.png" />
     <p>Later, when I began stacking in the columnar format I decided on, I realized that I would have excessive white space in the image. I mitigated this by rotating the email and phone icons, and widening the chat icon. Then they stacked much more easily.</p>
     <p>I also tried to incorporate the sun and moon into this graphic as well, to emphasize the necessity of staffing during daylight hours. Once again, the images didn't work along the graph lines or as part of the icon set. I finally settled on large, yet subtle background images that bled off the page. </p>

     <h2>Completed image</h2>
     <p>The final image uses these concepts from class:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Neutral color for a background to avoid eye strain</li>
       <li>Muting colors for the largest number of icons (yellow for the the reference desk location) to avoid overpowering the image.</li>
       <li>Using slightly brighter colors for the smaller sets of locations &mdash; these were made more transparent so they didn't stand out too much.</li>
       <li>Area alignment from <i>Universal Principles of Design</i> for the legend icons.</li>
     </ul>
